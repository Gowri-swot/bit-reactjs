## Bit
Bit is an open-source cli tool for collaborating on isolated components across projects and repositories.
Use Bit to distribute discrete components from a design library or a project into a standalone reusable package and utilize it across applications.
You can set up your own server for components collaboration, or use the bit.dev cloud hosting for private and public components sharing.
